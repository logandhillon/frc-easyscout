# FRC EasyScout

Internal scouting utility for FRC Team 5409.

FRC EasyScout automatically scans ScoutingPASS QR codes containing TSV match data and inputs them directly into a
spreadsheet processor — no manual copy/paste, no data entry overhead.

## What It Does

- Continuously scans all visible ScoutingPASS QR codes
- Parses embedded TSV data
- Automatically forwards structured data into your existing spreadsheet workflow
- Eliminates manual upload steps

## Why

Scouters should focus on collecting accurate match data — not managing files, tabs, or imports. This tool removes the
human step between QR scan and spreadsheet.

## Compatibility

- Designed to work with existing spreadsheet-based scouting systems
- Outputs TSV-compatible structured data
- Intended for internal team use
